Given the absence of any material change in the Group, we consider the following qualitative factors to remain appropriate. <br /><br /><table><tr><th>Qualitative Questions</th><th>Qualitative factors</th></tr><tr><td>Market Outlook (What is the Outlook of the Industry?)</td><td>3</td></tr><tr><td>Cost Competitiveness and Sustainability</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Quality of Market share and Supporting Assets</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Volatility of earnings and extent of risk mitigation</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Management Quality and Strategic Direction of the Company</td><td>2</td></tr><tr><td>Capital and Financial Risk Management</td><td>1</td></tr></table><br /><br /><ul><li>The model generated scores are reflective of the Group’s overall stable financial performance during FY16 with an expanded EBITDA margin despite slight moderation in revenues and largely stable net profit. Balance sheet continues to remain strong with low leverage and gearing ratio. </li><li>Consistent with previous analysis and approvals, we propose a 2 notch override to the raw CCR to account for FFA's dominant position within the telecommunication market, which is not adequately captured by the L&GE risk grading model, noting that the model generated CCR is partly driven by absolute scale, rather than relative scale. </li><li>Further, CCR2- remains consistent with the external indicators, noting the S&P rating of A-/Stable is unchanged (equivalent CCR2-), which remains within FFA's public commitment of retaining its rating within the 'A Band', and the KMV outcome remains largely stable at 0.02/CCR1=. Management quality remains appropriate at ‘2’ as evidenced by successful execution of complex strategies to date.</li><li>The XYZ Guarantor Group, which requires all subsidiaries accounting for >20% consolidated NPBT (Net Profit before Tax) and TTA (Total Tangible Assets) to be guarantors, ensures that’s we capture the vast majority of the credit strength of the consolidated group, given that the assets and earnings are not granular, but instead held by a relatively small number of wholly owned subsidiaries. </li><li>Based on the above continuation of CCR2- is recommended for the SFA Guarantor Group.</li></ul><br /><br /><b>Obligor group for the Market Limits: CCR2-G</b><br /><br />Exposure under the Markets limits is supported by the Parent and Finco. While the exposure is not supported by operating companies, we recommend maintaining the same CCR2- in line with the Group risk grade, on the basis that no notching is justified under JCR. In particular (with reference to CCR notching chart for holding companies included as an attachment): (i) Finco manages all Group debt so ANZ is parri passu with other financiers with respect to the Markets limits; (ii) a default under the Markets limits would cause default to the SFA; (iii) Group cash flows are most likely to be available to support the listed Parent; and (iv) there is relatively immaterial amounts of debt held at the operating company level, with the majority held by Finco, therefore protecting the residual equity position in the Parent’s shareholding in those entities.<br /><br /><b>Obligor group for the AUD5M Net Overdraft Facility (within the ICA): CCR2-G</b><br />The obligors largely constitute the same group as the SFA Guarantor Group, with the exception of JDL, and the EFC entities which is not required to be guarantors as they do not meet the requisite criteria. On that basis, we recommend that the CCR2- of the Group applies (and noting the maximum net exposure is small (NZD5M)).<br /><br /><b>Standalone obligors under the ICA, other than the Net Overdraft Facility: CCR5=G</b><br />The Standalone obligors under the ICA are TRC (AUD100k Card Facility, AUD40k Financial Guarantee Facility, AUD700k Inland Open LC & AUD17M EFT), MCG (AUD130k Commercial Card Facility, AUD2M IPL Facility & AUD9k Operating Lease Facility), FFA Trading (AUD6.5M Card Facility, AUD2.2M PPE limit & AUD30M IPL Facility) and TEFT (AUD200k Card Facility).<br /><br />No segregated financial accounts are available in respect of the above obligors.<br /><br />It is recommended to adopt a CCR5= rating (3 notch override from CCR6=, default risk grade with no financials) on the basis that most of these subsidiaries carry the listed parent name or have a strong brand in their own right (Magic Cloud). Further each entity is fully integrated into the Group business, in terms of management, and are considered “core”. This represents an exception to policy (see above).</html>"

Specifically, Voice Only now only accounts for AUD$600M of Group revenue, or 35%, while data and broadband is a growth business with plenty of demand.</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td><i>Execution risk of Strategy cost out and investment, including developing new revenue streams, capex to maintain market share</i></td><td><ul><li>These risks are typical for most telco companies.</li><li>Management are strong and have successfully achieved the first part of its strategy.

HY18 results provided some evidence that the strategy is succeeding with continued growth in mobile and IT Services revenue, with value add and multi-brand strategies helping to differentiate.</li><li>We will continue to monitor whether the strategy achieves further success, but given the industry remains dynamic and subject to rapid change, further cost-out and tight control over capex will be essential. XYZ's EBITDA margins sit around the top quartile of international benchmarks and therefore top line revenue growth is essential to drive earnings growth.

In 2002, flat steel products were demerged to form the publicly traded company XYZ Steel which, in 2003, became BlueScope Steel.<br/>In March 2005, XYZ Billiton announced a US$7.3 billion agreed bid for WMC Resources, owners of the Olympic Dam copper, gold and uranium mine in South Australia, nickel operations in Western Australia and Queensland, and a Queensland fertiliser plant. The takeover achieved 90 per cent acceptance on 17 June 2005, and 100 per cent ownership was announced on 2 August 2005, achieved through compulsory acquisition of the remaining 10 per cent of the shares.<br/><br/><b>Corporate Structure</b><br/>Given the change in industry, the company now provides a broader product than just copper-line mining services and accordingly, changed its retail name to XYZ in July 2012. XYZ is made up of the following four primary business units:<br/><ul><li><i>XYZ:</i> provider of miningfixed line, mobile and internet services to consumers and SME’s. It includes Special Ventures (see below);</li><li><i>MetCoal:</i> integrates IT and telecommunications services to provide converged ICT solutions to business and government customers using BIC's fixed and mobile infrastructure and cloud computing expertise.</li><li><i>CokingCoal:</i> develops, maintains, and operates XYZ's network and IT and other shared business operations as well as servicing wholesale and international customers; and </li><li><i>ThermalCoal:</i> aims to develop a portfolio of businesses intended to create long-term value by acting as an internal incubator. It aims to develop businesses that deliver connected digital experiences to customers, including by adopting disruptive business models, to attain and grow market share. This includes investing in mobile wallets, smart data monetisation (e.g. analytics), and a nationwide Wifi hotspot network.  Core businesses include Huey Mobile, Dewey Broadband, Louie (Internet) TV, Maschi telco and Opport wallets.</li></ul><br/><br/><b>Insights on Board & Management</b><br/><br/><b>XYZ Board</b><br/>Made up by 7 directors, of which 6 are independent, with the following key members<ul><li>John Smith - both an executive director and CEO since 2012 (see “Management” below).</li><li>David Shanks - Chairman (also current Chairman of Goldweavers and director of MetCoal),</li><li>Cameron Walker - independent direct (also Group Chief Technology Officer of fixed line infrastructure business BBW)</li><li>Other directors include David McCluskey, Dave Rock, Seamus O'Hair.</li><li>We consider the Board to be well balanced with depth of expertise in mining, telecommunications, finance, infrastructure and IT with the vast majority having been on the Board since 2011. In particular Smith and Shanks are well known through current and previous close associations with ANZ.</li></ul><br/><br/><b>BIC's Management</b><br/>The team remains largely unchanged, with the following key members:<ul><li>CEO and Executive Director: Smith has held these positions since 2012. Formerly Smith was the COO between 2003-2008, left to be CEO of RIO between 2008-2012, he was previously CEO of Deep Dark Wood between 1992-1999. Smith can largely be credited as the driving force behind the significant positive change, cost-out and brand reinvigoration under his leadership;</li><li>COO: Shanks joined XYZ in 2009 and has over 25 years’ experience in the telco sector, having held executive roles in business and technology functions in British Telecom, Cable & Wireless, IBM and PWC. Shanks has been a key part of XYZ's Digital strategy executing organisation wide systems/process re-engineering such that Twinkle has the correct low cost platforms to compete in a competitive market.</li><li>CFO: Andre Palayan joined XYZ in 2013, having worked previously at the XYZ-MetCoal Group for 12 years in senior financial roles. Prior to joining XYZ Palayan worked in Deloitte’s audit division for 8 years. Palayan has been involved in simplifying the core XYZ business, selling non-core operations and overseeing bolt-on acquisitions that adds to XYZ's core operations.</li><li>Overall internal governance framework is considered strong with extensive MIS, financial/management reporting, internal policies and controls, as well as significant audit and external oversight given XYZ's public nature, including public S&P rating.</li></ul><br/><br/><b>Industry Analysis</b><br/><br/><b>Coal Mining</b><br/>Coal is mined in every state of Australia except South Australia. It is used to generate electricity and is exported. 54% of the coal mined in Australia is exported, mostly to eastern Asia. In 2000/01, 258.5 million tonnes of coal was mined, and 193.6 million tonnes exported, rising to 261 million tonnes of exports in 2008–09. Coal also provides about 85% of Australia's electricity production. Australia is the world's leading coal exporter.<br/><br/><b>Uranium mining</b><br/>Uranium mining in Australia began in the early 20th century in South Australia. At 2016 Australia contained 29% of the world's defined uranium resources. The three largest uranium mines in the country are Olympic Dam, Ranger Uranium Mine and Beverley Uranium Mine. Future production is expected from Honeymoon Uranium Mine and the planned Four Mile Uranium Mine.<br/><br/><b>Natural gas</b><br/>Based on 2008 CSIRO report, Australia estimated to have stranded gas reserves with about 140 trillion cubic feet or enough to fulfil the needs of a city with one million people for 2,800 years.</html>"
