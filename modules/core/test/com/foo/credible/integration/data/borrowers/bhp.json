It is used to generate electricity and is exported. 54% of the coal mined in Australia is exported, mostly to eastern Asia. In 2000/01, 258.5 million tonnes of coal was mined, and 193.6 million tonnes exported, rising to 261 million tonnes of exports in 2008–09.Coal also provides about 85% of Australia's electricity production.

Future production is expected from Honeymoon Uranium Mine and the planned Four Mile Uranium Mine.<br><br><strong>Natural gas</strong><br>Based on 2008 CSIRO report, Australia estimated to have stranded gas reserves with about 140 trillion cubic feet or enough to fulfil the needs of a city with one million people for 2,800 years.</p>"
