At the expiry of this facility, the Relationship team would be looking to replace this asset with one of the following two options:&nbsp;</p><p>1. Exercise of the option to roll-over the facility for another 12 months (on the same facility agreement); OR&nbsp;</p><p>2. New GBP30M Revolving Credit Facility with an expected tenor of 3-5 years&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding the second option, we are aware that the client will be arranging new club facility in 2022 which they may chose to refinance early depending on prevailing financing conditions. This club will be for general corporate purposes and effectively a standby liquidity source for the Group i.e. this will not be incremental leverage. Hence the second option is essentially a bridge facility on a bilateral basis until we can position ourselves to participate in the club. Given the timing and actual terms of the bridge facility are not entirely known at this point, for the purpose of this Annual Review we are merely recommending the existing facilities on a no change basis and flagging the potential roll-over via a 3-5 year facility on expiry in Nov-21.</p>"

Balance sheet continues to remain strong with low leverage and gearing ratio.</li><li>Consistent with previous analysis and approvals, we propose a 2 notch override to the raw CCR to account for FFA's dominant position within the telecommunication market, which is not adequately captured by the L&amp;GE risk grading model, noting that the model generated CCR is partly driven by absolute scale, rather than relative scale.</li><li>Further, CCR2- remains consistent with the external indicators, noting the S&amp;P rating of A-/Stable is unchanged (equivalent CCR2-), which remains within FFA's public commitment of retaining its rating within the 'A Band', and the KMV outcome remains largely stable at 0.02/CCR1=. Management quality remains appropriate at ‘2’ as evidenced by successful execution of complex strategies to date.</li><li>The Rio Group, which requires all subsidiaries accounting for &gt;20% consolidated NPBT (Net Profit before Tax) and TTA (Total Tangible Assets) to be guarantors, ensures that’s we capture the vast majority of the credit strength of the consolidated group, given that the assets and earnings are not granular, but instead held by a relatively small number of wholly owned subsidiaries.</li><li>Based on the above continuation of CCR2- is recommended for the SFA Guarantor Group.</li></ul>"
